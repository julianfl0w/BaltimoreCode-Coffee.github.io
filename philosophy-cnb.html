        <p>
          What's the difference between an introverted and an extroverted
          computer scientist? An extroverted computer scientist will look at
          your shoes in a conversation, instead of their own! Indeed,
          yesterday's programmer could afford the luxury of antisocial behavior
          and lived a comfortable existence in a single apartment. Sadly this is
          no longer the case. As more and more people choose programming
          professions, nerds have been increasingly forced to come out of their
          shells and engage with the outside world.

          Programming has become an increasingly social discipline. This need
          for community engagement and networking is reflected in Baltimore Code
          and Coffee's growing attendance numbers. Rising unemployment and the
          success of GPT4 in writing code have put our field in an unprecedented
          position. The world is looking to us to see what's going to happen.

          Following a dreadful global pandemic, something interesting was
          happening at Spark and Digital Harbor Foundation buildings. The nerds
          were coming together in mutual understanding. Powered by coffee and
          donuts, they were conversing and building and learning! For a time,
          the world didn't seem so scary.
        </p>

          But after a while, it became clear that something was up with the
          state of computer science. People were getting burned out at their
          jobs. They were resigning en masse. Large corporations descended into
          decay. And then.. the layoffs. At first it was seen as a temporary
          thing. People said, Oh, it's just the excess workforce picked up
          during pandemic, or Oh, it's just the season for layoffs. But they
          just kept coming, month after month, company after company. Google,
          Intel, Amazon. Startups became scarce. Interest rates rose, yet
          inflation was rampant. Housing costs and medical bills rose
          dramatically. It seemed there was no hope.

          The Organizers met privately after every public meeting for a private
          retrospective. Sponsors and partners came and went. The organizers
          themselves had lives and jobs and family to take care of. Yet they
          stayed strong and took care of each other. Armed with nothing but a
          shoestring budget and a little bit of know-how, they prepared for the
          coming days.
